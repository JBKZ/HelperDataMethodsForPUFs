Usage 

What is the usage of a PUF or what does a PUF?

Physical Unclonable Functions (PUFs) using manufacturing variability in electric circuits to "build"
a reliable cryptographic key in embedded (electric) circuits. Each Puf is diffrent even if
they pass through the same manufacturing process. That is because each IC which ",will be used in a PUF," is diffrent 
even if they (also) pass throught the same manufacturing process ("as well.")
PUFs use those variability to derive (secret) information that is unique to a chip( a silicon "biometric")

"Some PUF types can be configured with challenges and give unpredictable responses based on the applied challenge.
These PUFs can be used for secure authentication.Other PUFs show one unique pattern similar to a biometric fingerprint.
These patterns are the foundation for secure key generation with PUFs."1

"Physical Unclonable Funktions are circuits that measure manufacturing variations to derive a unique secret inside a
device to use it as cryptographic key or to authenticate a device." 2

"PUF circuits are designed to amplify the effects of manufacturing variations in the circuit and extract a unique response pattern for each device."


How will a PUF be manufacture?

Where will Pufs be used and How will PUfs be used in this instance? 

Diffrent types of PUFs? 

Are they any advantages for using PUFs? 

"One main advantage of PUFs is that they provide secure keys for circuits manufactured in standard CMOS technology
that do not have access to state-of-the art secure storage solutions such as secure flash memory."
