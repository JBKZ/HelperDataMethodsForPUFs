Systematic Low Leakage (SLLC

What is Systematic Low Leakage and where will it be used? Also what does SLLC?

Systematic Low Leakage Coding (SLLC) is a(n) algorithm (protocol, technique, procedure) for Physical Unclonable Functions.
SLLC uses the entire 'PUF-answer' and keeps the size of 'Helper Data' to a Minimum. or (and keeps a minimal size of 'Helper Data'.)
This approach will often be used by PUFs that only have to correct  a small amount of errors. A big advantgage in comparison
to similar approaches is that the 'Helper Data' does not giva any information about the 'reproduced secret' key. 

Which code construction are nessesary/sufficiently for using SSLC ?
