Low-Density-Parity-Check-Code

Introduction 

	
-linear block codes for error correction // linear error correcting code 
- a method to transmitting a message over a noisy transmission channel. 
-LDPC is constructed using a sparse bipartite graph
-describes a matrix with many interrelated/connected 'parity checks'
-LDPC codes are capacity-approaching codes
-Redundancy is used, here, to increase the chance of recovering from channel errors.
-the control matrix concept will be used 
		--> H*b(transpose) = 0 , H represents the control matrix 
		--> b stands for the received code symbols ( 'row vector')

Notation 

(n,l,R) LDPC

n= 'code word length' 
l= amount of  information values/digits 
R= 'code rate'

Regular and irregular Codes 

A LDPC-code 'whose' control matrix has in 'each' row and in each column the same amount of ones will be called (regular -k).
A LDPC-code 'whose' control matrix does not fulfill those characteristics will be called (irregular -k).

Construktion of LDPC-Codes 

- LPCD-codes will be discribed by 'their' depending control matrix 
- The generator matrix which/that is be  required  to establish code words can/could be derived with the gauﬂ-jordan approach. 

Practical use

Euklidische Geometrie 

The 'inzidenz matrices' of the euclidean geometry and the projective geometry including 'finite bodies' are suitably
to construct 'niedergewichtige' dual codes that can be used to create a 'check matrix'
